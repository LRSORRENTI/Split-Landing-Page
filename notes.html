        These are notes I'll write during this exercise/project, going to use a
        linked stylesheet for the project and style tags in my notes

        Okay so the CSS is mostly done, traversy uses CSS in a way that's
        unfamiliar to me, it definitely shows that I need to practice CSS more,
        his use of ':hover', and setting variables in the root are things I've
        never done before
